            <!-- bulletpoint chronological list of accomplishments -->
            <ul id="tribute-list">
                <li>He was an experienced fighter, able to fight well with even a simple pickaxe.</li>
                <li>Was quite fashionable, all Dwarves of DRG think of whether he'd approve of their style from time to time.</li>
                <li>Liked having drinks with his fellow colleagues, which may have been his downfall.</li>
                <li>Had an ego to match his reputation, as fame often leads one to adopt.</li>
                <li>Reported record-holder for most minerals and gold mined in one mission.</li>
                <li>Was possibly employed as a scout by Deep Rock Galactic.</li>
                <li>One of the first Dwarves to set foot on Hoxxes IV in a prospecting expedition.</li>
                <li>Supposedly he drank too much "Skull Crusher" ale before this mission, which must have seemed to be a routine incursion at the time.</li>
                <li>His coworkers were forced to leave him behind; whether he too injured to make it to the escape pod, or if he willingly distracted the horrors of Hoxxes so that they could escape, is unknown.</li>
                <li>The Hollow Bough was most likely the place he was left behind, though if he wasn't injured, it is possible that he could be in another area.</li>
                <li>Unfortunately, it is quite likely he has died. Even despite the hostile flora and fauna of Hoxxes IV, it is likely that there's not enough food, water, or ale to have sustained him for so long.</li>
            </ul>
